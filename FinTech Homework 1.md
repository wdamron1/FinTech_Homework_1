# Opendoor
## Overview and Origin
 

The company was founded and incorporated in 2013 by co-founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu.
"Eric Wu has a history of working within the real estate market, co-founding [Rent Advisor](www.rentadvisor.com), an apartment finding website. and founding [Movity](www.movity.com), a website that aggregated and analyzed geo-data. These two websites certainly influenced Eric to have very detailed insight into the housing and apartment markets. Eric continues to be on the leadership team as the CEO/co-founder. Eric Wu has also been quoted saying, "Real estate is part of my DNA". Eric Wu also graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in economics. Opendoor's first city was Phoenix, AZ.
"Keith Rabios does not have quite the real estate background as Eric, however he does have a long history of being at the executive level of many tech companies, such as Square, LinkedIn, and Epoch Innovations. This experience is likely what helped Eric move his company into the forefront of the online real estate world. Keith does not show up on the [Opendoor](www.opendoor.com) website under the leadership team [page](https://www.opendoor.com/w/about).
   
Opendoor has received a total of 1.5 BILLION in venture funding, as currently on their series E funding type. There have been a total of 63 investors since its founding in 2013. Opendoor has also acquired two companies, OS National and Open Listings.

## Business Activities

    "One financial problem open door is seeing is that when they purchase a home from a seller, they may have to keep the houses on their books longer than they would ideally like to. This creates a problem from a risk management standpoint as the longer the houses on not sold, the more the company has to pay in property taxes, etc. Another financial problem Opendoor has is that many users complain that the offer they receive from Opendoor is far too low, even by local market standards. This could be due to the algorithm/formula they use to price houses is not 100 percent accurate. They can solve this issue by adding in more variables to asses the value of a home i.e. home improvement costs, local housing price increases, and the amount of money the previous homeowner spent to increase their homes value. Zillow is also another problem that Opendoor is facing, they currently boast a great deal of content which already brings in a lot of customers. Opendoor will need to boost their outreach in order to increase their market share. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The companies intended customer is anyone who would like to purchase or sell their home without going through the long and tedious process of using a broker, mortgage lender, and real estate agency in person. Young/first time home buyers are also the target market as the older generations are more reluctant to use technology to go through this process. This doesn't necessarily mean the older generation will not use their product, it just means it is not their primary target base. Opendoor is very easy to use on purpose, meaning anyone who puts in a little effort will be able to use it. I was able to find that Opendoor recieves 2,300 monthly views, compared to Zillows [270,000 monthly views](https://overthinkgroup.com/opendoor/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most other online home brokers perform many other tasks such as in person real estate brokers and loans. The unfair advantage that Opendoor utilizes is that the company's sole focus is online and mobile home buying/selling, thus that is their only concern and they can focus their entire staff and efforts towards it. For example, Remax offers a tremendous amount of in-person products and services, which takes away from their online home buying platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The technologies Opendoor is using are thanks to the companies Eric Wu founded or was a part of before he co-founded Opendoor. As stated above, Movity compiles aggregated and analyzed geo-data of large cities and towns. It takes in noise, commuting times, school boundaries, and home prices to create an accurate estimate of home prices. When these technologies are implemented, it allows Opendoor to [reduce the total cost percentage](https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/how-opendoors-costs-compare-with-traditional-home-sale) compared to traditional home selling. The average being around 3 percent less. Opendoor also uses 'best-of-breed' technologies via cloud-based, web-delivered applications. \n",

    "Opendoor is currently in the real estate market. It provides an service of buying and selling homes online, compared to the traditional method of buying/selling homes. Users of Opendoor are also able to trade-in their homes using their service. These processes are available online and through the use of their app which can be used on any regular smart device. After the 2008 housing crisis, many people are wary to trust the banks and other lending agencies that provide loans to customers, thus providing a space for new companies like Opendoor to flourish. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The major trends and innovations of this domain include using complex formulas and algorithms to determine the price of a home. This method has been coined iBuyer by Opendoor and is a much easier and faster process. Traditionally a home estimator would have to come to your home to walk around and provide an accurate estimate of your homeâ€™s value. Now, with Opendoor, you do not have to go through the long and painful process at the mercy of the real estate company. Opendoor has been expanding to more and more cities since its creation, and has continued plans to move into larger urban areas. As more people flock to the suburbs and to cities, many previous cities that were once considered small, are seeing large influx of family homes being built and purchased. A very important trend to notice is that Opendoor has continued to raise a high amount of capital. Since 2014, Opendoor has gone from Series A funding, to Series E funding. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other major companies in this domain are Zillow, Redfin, and Remax to name a few. From what I have seen, Zillow has become very popular for looking up houses in your area. My friends and I use it very often due to the ease of the site, but I do not know a single person who has used it to buy/sell their homes. These companies have clearly noticed the popularity of Opendoor's policies, and are trying to mimic the ease and simplicity of buying/selling a home. Re/Max has also issued stock, however it is not performing as well as Redfin has. It is currently trading around [the same price as it was offered at](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RMAX/). Opendoor has not issued any stock as it is a private company. Zillow is currently much farther ahead than Opendoor in the online outreach portion of their business.
    
 ## Results

    "This company has become extremely popular with new and old homebuyers. Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, home buyers/sellers are more reluctant to let people into their homes to walk around, increasing the risk of spreading the virus. As the world becomes more and more technologically advanced, people are going to be moving away from traditionally slower methods of selling/buying homes and moving towards more technologically advanced yet simpler ways of home buying/selling. As I have mentioned above, it is import for Opendoor to increase their outreach to their marketbase.\n",
 
    "Some core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success is their year over year homes sold. Another core metric is the price of the home they can sell, and the profits that the domain can secure using these technologies. In 2017, Opendoor saw a 150% increase in homes sold. A major core metric that is used is the number of cities/areas that Opendoor operates in. Currently, Opendoor operates in [21 cities](https://www.opendoor.com/w/faq/cities-opendoor-buy-sell-homes) across the United States. The size and prices of the houses Opendoor is willing to purchase is another important indicator. As of 2020, Opendoor only purchases homes between [100,000 and 750,000](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/opendoor-offerpad-resume-home-buying-operations-following-coronavirus-shutdown-2020-05-06) dollars. In Phoenix, the typical housing prices purchased are as shown:\n",

    "Redfin issued an IPO in 2017, since then the stock has reached an all-time high of 39.29 as of last week. It appears that the Coronavirus has improved the stock price substantially, even after the initial [all time low in early 2020](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00q4P1bpaVq6f07RlUu4IMJwrUaug%3A1593194735810&ei=7zj2XqyBMdj4-gSx2YGQAQ&q=redfin+stock&oq=redfin+stock&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIICAAQsQMQkQIyCAgAELEDEJECMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgQIABBDMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECCMQJzoHCAAQsQMQQzoFCAAQkQI6BQgAELEDOgcIABAUEIcCOgUIABCDAToKCAAQsQMQFBCHAlDIa1ineWDeemgBcAB4AIABgQGIAb8KkgEDNy42mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjstKTyiKDqAhVYvJ4KHbFsABIQ4dUDCAw&uact=5). Opendoor has not issued any stock, as they are still taking private funding. Their private funding has been exceptional and they have received 1.5 billion since opening. Opendoor has been performing much better than Redfin in this aspect, as Redfin has only raised [319.6 billion](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/redfin) since its founding. Zillow is leading the forefront in customer outreach at this time.\n",

    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Advice I would give would be to have a database of all the home improvements, such as file numbers for countertops, cabinets, carpets, size of appliances etc, and have it cross referenced to another database which could accurately factor in those costs into their offer. The online real estate market is quite simple, which is why it has become so popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think offering these products would increase Opendoor's bottom line. Charging a fee to give a more accurate estimate would lower the return on the house in that aspect, however the charge of having to send someone out to appraise it would make back that lost money, if not generate more. Opendoor could partner with one or multiple large home remodeling companies which would provide access to their data and cost analysis models. Partnering with these companies could also improve the companyâ€™s value as it would signal to investors that Opendoor is being proactive with their data analysis and research. The biggest home improvement stores come as no surprise as they are Home Depot and Lowes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The technology that the tracking of the home improvements would utilize would probably be python, or any big data platform that would be able to cross examine the prices against the formula's the company has in place. It would take extensive work for Opendoor to create this database but I believe once it is created, it would be extremely useful. This would also require more servers and processing power for quick and simple analysis. However, if Opendoor were able to partner with these major home improvement stores, they could be able to split the price for this new service. AWS could provide the servers for a fee. \n",
    "\n",
    "These technologies are appropriate because the lack of an in person home price estimator requires an algorithm to accurately determine the price of the house, which may not get it right 100 percent of the time without all the details. Implementing a database with accurate serial numbers can increase or decrease the price of home, reducing the risk of overpaying. It would also be extremely time consuming and costly to do this analysis by hand or by researching it for each individual house.\n",
